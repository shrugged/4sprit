LEGO-MAN
manifesto
from a loyal retriever
i was blind
now the light is blinding me
-
cause surviving
pretending
is gonna kill me
but i have to try
the promise i made
cannot be broken
-
the ghost of me casperly:
	bricks by bricks
	blocks by blocks
	one at a time
	building on a rock
	from the ground up
	iam becoming a man
	slowly 
	pull throught
	every color of the rainbow
	blue
	green
	red
	purple
	yellow
	black
	white
	pain is the cost of 
	doing business
	to grow

the price to pay to be reborn

it is what is it
trial by fire
