manifesto
from a loyal dog
-
cause surviving
pretending
is gonna kill me
but i have to try
the promise i made
cannot be broken
-
bricks by bricks
blocks by blocks
one at a time
building on a rock
from the ground up
iam becoming a man
slowly 
pull throught
every color of the rainbow
blue
green
red
purple
yellow
black
white

the price to pay to be reborn
