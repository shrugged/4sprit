LEGO-MAN
manifesto
from a loyal retriever
for all the DAYS
	i wish i was still deadstilled
	alas the show must go on

i was blind
now the light is blinding me
-
cause surviving
pretending
is gonna kill me
but i have to try
the promise i made
cannot be broken
-
the ghost of me casperly\
	the phantom of the opera:
		bricks by bricks
			blocks by blocks
				one at a time
					building on a rock
						from the ground up
							iam becoming a man
								slowly 
									pull throught every throll
		
every color of the rainbow skittleble
		blue
		green
		red
		purple
		yellow
		black
		white
pain is the cost of 
doing business
to grow

the price to pay to be reborn
can't cheat myself out of this one
if i want what i want
it is what is it
trial by fire
killsquatted
actively embalmed

maybe one day i see you on the other side of the mirror
with my eyes openned
