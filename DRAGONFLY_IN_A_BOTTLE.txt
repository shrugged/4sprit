POOP
my ballon is burstring
a stormly storm in a teacup 
the moment triump-funly funnilly
	sound the phanfare
		ring the trumpets
rock the BOAT, make waves
	rupple (CHIPS), some feathers
		poke the bear'south
surf on a lightingstorm in a bottle 
illuminatated wow
flash in a panned pan
ooops

stickedly-stick in the mudmud
Evens nice guys finish lasting last
