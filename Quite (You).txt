Quite (You)

Blue eyes
Pink nails
Mangled words
You blush
Tell me
What
A story
Ok
I do the wrong thing
Why do I always push you?
(Sorry)
Take a breath

What?
I shrug
But You still listen

Why are you so
(quite) exceptionally you?

Blue eyes
Pretty nails
Puffy cheeks
You blush
Why are you so beautiful?

Mangled words
I do the wrong thing
Why do I always push you?
(sorry)
But You still listen....

Played dumb
So innocent
Or so Evil
But where is the love?


Why are you so
(quite) exceptionally you?
